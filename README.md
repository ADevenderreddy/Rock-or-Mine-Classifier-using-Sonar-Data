# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Sonar Dataset 🪨🔍🌊

This project uses a machine learning model to classify objects as either **rock** or **mine** based on sonar signals. This kind of model can be used in **submarine sonar systems** to enhance the accuracy of detecting underwater objects.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a binary classification model that can:
- Take sonar frequency features as input
- Predict whether the object detected is a rock or a mine
